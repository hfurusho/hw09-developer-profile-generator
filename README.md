# Developer Profile Generator

## About

This application quickly generates a github profile page as a html file and pdf file. It does so by prompting the user for their username and to select from a list of 4 color themes. "index.js" will then grab the github user profile information via an axios call and create an html file. The html is then used in puppeteer to generate the PDF file.
